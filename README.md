# Python scripts to control the Arbitrary Signal Module on a RedPitaya board

The scripts were tested on Version: 1.04, Build: 18 of the Red Pitaya GNU/Linux Ecosystem using Python 3.5.

These scripts use the periphery module which is already installed in the latest releases of the RedPytaya ecosystem.  



## Installation

The simplest way to install the code is to clone the repository and copy the file called ASG-Elephant.ipynb to the directory /home/jupyter on the RedPitaya 

Then you can open "Development" and "Jupyter Python Programming" on the RedPitaya web page menu.

An alternative is to use an ssh-tunnel.

On the latest ecosystems Jupyter Notebook is already installed. Otherwise you need to install it.


## Credits

- I thank the RedPitaya software developpers for their tremendous effort. The scripts presented here are infinitely simpler compared to what they have done.
